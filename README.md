# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis via Python

## Project Objective

The purpose of this project was to use python to analyze data given by Instacart in order to derive insights on specific segments of the customer population as well as answering key questions given by company stakeholders

##  Key Questions

- Sales team needs to know the busiest days of the week along with the busiest hours of the day
- Would also like to know whether there are particular times of day when people spend the most money
- Marketing and Sales would like products lumped into groups based on price to more easily digest data
- Would also like to know which departments have the highest frequencies of orders
- Marketing and sales are interested in different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ
- Examples of customer segmenting include brand loyalty, region, age, family status, and income.
